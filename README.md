### Project Overview:

1. what we did and why we did it

    We developed an open source eclipse plugin with a text editor that can have Github Flavored Markdown (GFM) syntax
    rendered in a tabbed browser when the user saves their document. This was accomplished for a capstone Software
    Engineering course at Drexel University with the intention of creating a plugin that will be useful to many of
    Drexel's corporate partners who use eclipse and need a text editor plugin that strictly supports GFM. 

2. how its better than other implementations
	
	There are many eclipse markdown editor plugins but none strictly adhere to GFM syntax. This can be troublesome
	for companies who want their employees to be able to edit text documents in eclipse while strictly adhering to
	GFM syntax. (some comment about why a company would want to only use GFM)
	
3. benefits of eclipse pop up window via browser vs other way?
